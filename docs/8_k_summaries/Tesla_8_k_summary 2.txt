Tesla, Inc. filed a Form 8-K report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 2, 2024, detailing its operations and financial condition. The report, originating from its headquarters in Austin, Texas, announced Tesla's vehicle production and delivery figures for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the entire year. In Q4, Tesla produced approximately 495,000 vehicles and delivered over 484,000, with Model 3/Y making up the majority of these figures. For the year 2023, Tesla saw a 38% year-over-year growth in vehicle deliveries, totaling 1.81 million, and a 35% increase in production, reaching 1.85 million vehicles. The company expressed gratitude to its customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, and supporters for their contributions to a successful year.

Tesla also announced that it would post its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 after the market closes on January 24, 2024. A live Q&A webcast with Tesla management to discuss the company's financial and business results and outlook is scheduled for the same day. The report emphasizes that Tesla vehicle deliveries are only one measure of the company's financial performance and should not be solely relied upon as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which are influenced by various factors including sales costs, foreign exchange movements, and the mix of directly leased vehicles.
