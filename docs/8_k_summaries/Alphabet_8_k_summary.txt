Alphabet Inc. has issued a warning to its shareholders regarding an unsolicited mini-tender offer from TRC Capital Investment Corporation to purchase up to 1 million shares of Alphabetâ€™s Class C capital stock at $138.90 per share, which is approximately 4.48 percent below the market price as of February 6, 2024. Alphabet advises its shareholders not to tender their shares, highlighting that the offer price is below the current market value and comes with numerous conditions. The company emphasizes that it is not affiliated with TRC Capital Investment and points out that mini-tender offers, such as this, are not subject to the same regulatory protections as larger tender offers. Alphabet urges shareholders to consult with their financial advisors and exercise caution. The offer is set to expire on March 8, 2024, but can be withdrawn by shareholders who have already tendered their shares.
